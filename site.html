        <p style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:20%">The ‘Mother’s Pride School, Dhemaji has been established in 2008 at 1 no. Nareng Survey Village, Aradhal Panchayat of Dhemaji District. It is approximately 2.5 km away from Dhemaji main town. There is an all weather road connecting main town and other parts of district. The present educational scenario has compelled us to redefine the meaning of education from the in vogue conventional definition. Today a school has become a centre of activity with all the possible facilities to foster all round development of a child. Gone are the days when the pupils were thrown in to an atmosphere of crowded classroom, Traditional method of teaching, lack of creative orientation, Unhealthy surroundings and incomplete communication that produced not a learned and potential citizen in the modern era. The educated one proved himself neither beneficial to the rapidly developing scientific world, nor posses the capacity to compete in the true sense. Hence “DHEMAJI EDUCATION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY” has given birth to ‘MOTHER’S PRIDE SCHOOL, DHEMAJI’ with a new concept of education with all the essential for harmonius development of child’s all round development.
